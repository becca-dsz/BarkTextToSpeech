## Language Models
Chatgpt, powered by a model called GPT is based on a deep learning architecture called Transformers. Transformers have sparked a major boom in modern AI because of their capability to understand and generate human-like text. 

## What is a Language Model?
Language models are machine learning models designed to predict the next word in a sentence, given a sequence of previous words. Examples: Gmail's auto-complete, Google's BERT (Bidrectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). GPT is a large language model due to its billions of parameters and massive training dataset, making it more powerful than models like BERT.
